# Research – Simmental Quality Classifier

This folder contains the Jupyter notebooks developed for the thesis **“Classification of Simmental Cattle Based on Body Conformation Using Machine Learning.”**  
The notebooks implement the training and evaluation of deep learning models for both **cows** and **bulls**.

## Contents
- `cattle.ipynb` – Notebook for training and evaluating models on Simmental cow images.  
- `bulls.ipynb` – Notebook for training and evaluating models on Simmental bull images.  

## Notes
- These notebooks were the basis for all experiments reported in the thesis.  
- They are designed to run in a Python environment with TensorFlow/Keras.  
- Models and datasets are not included here due to size restrictions.
